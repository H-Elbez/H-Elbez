ðŸ”­  I am currently an AI R&D Engineer at CITC-EuraRFID, holding a Ph.D. in computer science. My research focuses on the interactive analysis of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to gain deeper insights into these networks and propose enhancements. Additionally, I have several years of experience as a mobile app developer.<br><br>
  
Furthermore, I actively contribute to the tech community as a co-organizer at the Google Developers Group in Ghardaia, where I also serve as a Flutter trainer. Additionally, I am a member of the Club Scientifique des Oasis (CSO). My expertise extends beyond research and development; I have had the privilege of speaking at events like TedX and WikiStage, addressing topics primarily related to technology.<br><br>
